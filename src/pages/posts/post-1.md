Welcome to my _new blog_ powered by Astro! This is my first post, and I'm excited to try something new.

## What are the sounds of Lancaster, Pennsylvania? 

It's easier to say "Lancaster" instead of Mount Joy, a small town one Amtrak stop past Lancaster City, or ~ 15-20 minutes by car. 

The surrounding towns in Lancaster, Pennsylvania encompassed sounds of horse and buggies clicking against the road, of construction (housing/barn building mainly), of the Amtrak cruising along Route 30 or Thomas the Tank Engine setting off at the Strasburg Railroad. Sounds of small town festivals and celebration, of protest against COVID-19 regulations, of church bells ringing off in the distance. The most memorable sound one might hear in Lancaster is the clicking and clacking of the Amish persons’ horse as they travel to church, to the store downtown, or to the neighbor’s abode. It’s a sound, that regardless of the reservations I may have about my hometown, will forever remind me of my roots (quite literally).

Lancaster County is majority white, with pockets of diverse ethnic groups like African Americans, Laos, Cambodians, Chinese, Korean, and LatinX folks. I’m not too confident in my description of the age and sex demographics, but if I were to guess it would trend more older than younger, and more female than male (pure speculation).
