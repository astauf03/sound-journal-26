# My First Blog Post

Published on January 15, 2026

Welcome to my _new blog_ powered by Astro! This is my first post, and I'm excited to try something new.

## What I have accomplished so far

1. **Set up and configured Astro** for blogging.

2. **Making pages** using by creating new `.astro` in the `src/pages` folder

3. **Writing posts** as a Markdown file! 

## What's next?

Finishing up the Astro tutorial. The hope is to make my professional portfolio site next!
